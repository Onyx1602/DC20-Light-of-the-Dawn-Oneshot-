Lanterns glow, music fills the air, and both frogfolk and humans share in the joy of peace hard-won. Yet beneath the laughter lurk hidden secrets and quiet dealings in the Gloamway. When shadow assassins strike and strange creatures stir, the festival’s brilliance begins to dim. What begins as a day of merriment quickly turns into a desperate struggle to preserve the light before it flickers away forever.</p>",
